It is a terrible thing to wake up 
with a hangover. It seemed like 
such a boon to win a 
mystery honeymoon package. 

Yesterday you married 
your best friend in 
front of family and friends. 
After a full day of celebrations 
you leave for the airport 
with your new wife and 
your mystery honeymoon package.

Halfway on the flight they offer 
you a local drink from your destination. 
It tastes great and you keep them coming. 
But when you party for a day and a night, 
life will catch up with you. 

Your head is starting to hurt. 
You donâ€™t know for certain where you are. 
You can hear new noises outside 
and you can already feel your 
tummy telling you 
the party went on a little long.
